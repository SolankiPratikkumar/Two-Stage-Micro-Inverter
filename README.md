## Frequent Asked Question:
### (Q) What is Microinverter?
### Solution: 
* A microinverter is a device used in solar power systems to convert the direct current (DC) electricity generated by a single solar panel into alternating current (AC) electricity suitable for use in homes or businesses or any other application.
* A microinverter extracts and converts energy from PV module and to boost efficiency, microinverters employ Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT), optimizing the PV module's operating voltage for peak efficiency under any conditon.

### (Q) How is Power Supply Unit(PSU) is connected and its Flow?
### Solution: 
* The Power Supply Unit have the inputs from external supply and from PV module(pin PV+) generated output of upto 24V so it can use any of the input and generate the output of +12V,+5V for primary circuit and generates secondary outputs of +12V, + 5 and it uses +2V , +1.65V as reference voltage for Voltage Regulator with High PSRR and Shunt Regulator and capacitor banks circuits.

## Connection & Flow & I/O Pins of Level 1 Micro-Inverter: 
### PV Module: 
* Converts solar irradiance into electrical energy of DC of range 0- 25V, providing voltage and current based on sunlight intensity as an output to through PV+ and PV- Terminals.
### PV Voltage Sense: 
* Measures PV voltage using PV+ providing sensed value by VPV_SEN output pin to Microcontroller of 3.3V output and to Display the reading using microcontroller and also the input voltages of 5V primary , 3.3V secondary are input use for operating this block from PSUs.
### PV Current Sense: 
* It uses the PV- pin for reading the current value generated by PV module and for operating this block we use 5V secondary input from PSUs and the sensed output reading are send to Microcontroller and Display block by IPV_SEN pin.
### DC-DC Converter: 
* It is 1:4 Boost converter which step up 0-24V,0-10A maximum input through pin PV+ and PV- to 180V, 1A output which is almost the voltage ranges we use for generation of AC output for Grid Level through pin VBUS.Also it uses 12V PWM signal for Duty cycle and MPPT algorithm signal through pins FLYBACK_DRV_1A and VS1.
### DC/AC Inverter: 
* It converts DC power through input pin VBUS to AC through pin HBRIDGE2 and AC_N_OUT for grid-tied operation, supported by the Inverter Gate Driver and microcontroller using duty cycle for operating Q3,Q4,Q5,Q6 Transistor through pin INV_DRV_1H and pin INV_DRV_2L. also it uses LCL Filter because the output is not perfect sine from this transistor.
### Grid Connection: 
* Allows electricity AC through input pin HBRIDGE2 and AC_N_OUT from the inverter to be fed into the Grid through output pins N and L.Also its readings are sense by microcontroller from GRID_RLY_CTRL pin to Display it. And it uses +12V_SEC DC from PSU to its internal circuits.
### Flyback Gate Driver: 
* Provides isolation and controls the DC/DC converter's switching operation and its inputs pins are received from FLYBACK_PWM_1A and FLYBACK_PWM_1B through microcontroller block by MPPT Algorithm Tracking.The input power pins to circuitry of this block are +5V Primary and 3.3V Secondary . Also the generated output are received to
output by pins VS1 and FLYBACK_DRV_1A for DC-DC Converter.
### Inverter Gate Driver: 
* It provide the PWM signal from microcontroller by input pins INV_PWM_1H and INV_PWM_2L to DC-AC Inverter block using output pins of INV__1H and INV_DRV_2L and it is powered by +12V Secondary and the VBUS voltage value is also sense by this block to send information to microcontroller and display it .
### Grid Voltage Sense: 
* Measures grid voltage using pins L and N and for the circuit operation we need to use reference voltage of 3.3V and 1.65V with the zero crossing detector to output pin V_ZERO_TST to finally produce frequency count and readings for output through pin VGRID_SEN which is given to microcontroller and display.
### Grid Current Sense: 
* Measures grid current using input pins HBRIDGE2 and AC_N_OUT and for the circuit operation we need to use 5V and 3.3V secondary from PSU. And the output generated at pin IGRID_SEN which is given to microcontroller and display to produce present value of AC Grid.
### Microcontroller & Display : 
* It is the main control block of the system to sense the DC inputs of PV,DC-DC Converter, DC-AC Inverter, Grid AC Voltage and current values and produce the Display Reading and also to produce the ouput PWM signal for Flyback Gate driver circuits and Inverter Gate driver Circuit using internally USB Port so that by MATLAB or other software we can run the MPPT Algorithm software as there is processing IC FT2232HQ-REEL is used along with ATMEGA 328P IC which will produce the Duty cycle and by processing through I2C lines of SCL,SDA,SCK we would get the readings on Display of all the inputs and outputs.
